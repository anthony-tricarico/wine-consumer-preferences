## Why is conjoint analysis beneficial {background-color="#EFEFC9"}

One of the main struggles in business analysis and market research is understanding the real preferences of the consumers. Using simple opinion surveys might not be sufficient to understand what consumers prefers. 

Choice based conjoint analysis is a more advance methodological procedure used in market research that allows to get explicitly which combinations of product's attributes and their levels are preferred by the consumers.
