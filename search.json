    "text": "Why is Conjoint Analysis Beneficial\nOne of the main struggles in business analysis and market research is understanding the real preferences of the consumers. Using simple opinion surveys might not be sufficient to understand what consumers prefers.\nChoice based conjoint analysis is a more advanced methodological procedure used in market research that allows to get explicitly which combinations of product’s attributes and levels are preferred by the consumers.\nIndeed, conjoint analysis can be defined as “any decompositional method that estimates the structure of a consumer’s preferences in terms of the levels of attributes of the alternatives” (Rao, 2014).\n\nSpeaker notes go here."

    "text": "The case study selected\nThis project is focused on investigating consumers’ preferences in the wine sector, focusing specifically on wines from canteens in the region of Trentino. We decided to conduct our analysis on this type of product as it is something that can have many attributes, each with many levels, so it was an interesting object of study for a choice based conjoint analysis."
